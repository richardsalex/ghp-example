# JNL 221 - Example repository

Think of this repository like a folder on your computer. In JNL 221, you're frequently organizing our HTML, CSS and content files for different projects in one folder. Once everything is working the way you want it to locally (meaning on your own machine), you can upload those files to a Github repository and maintain the organizational structure you used there.

### How this example repository is organized:

```
├── images/
│   ├── Armorysquaresyr.jpg
│   ├── Destiny_USA.png
│   └── Syrcityhall2.jpg
├── index.html
├── other.html
└── README.md (the file you're reading)
```

### Things to keep in mind:
* __File names matter.__ Even a slight difference will throw things off. `index.html` is different than `index(3).html` and `INDex.HTML`
* __Paths to files matter.__ If I want to show the image `Armorysquaresyr.jpg` in my HTML file, I have to point toward `images/Armorysquaresyr.jpg` because it's located inside a folder. (More on [file paths](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp).)
* __Your core HTML file should be named "index.html".__ The URL for this repository is [https://richardsalex.github.io/pages-example/](https://richardsalex.github.io/pages-example/) and will go directly to `index.html`.
* __Changes may not be instantaneously reflected online.__ If I'm getting a 404 page when I go to the above URL, I can try visiting the pages individually: [https://richardsalex.github.io/pages-example/index.html](https://richardsalex.github.io/pages-example/index.html) or [https://richardsalex.github.io/pages-example/other.html](https://richardsalex.github.io/pages-example/other.html). If it's not working, see "__File names matter__" or "__Paths to files matter__" above.

### I want to:
* __Upload all my files.__ 
* __Upload an individual file.__
* __Edit a file.__
* __Remove a file.__
* __Publish my repository to Github Pages.__
