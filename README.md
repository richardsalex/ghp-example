JNL 221 example repository published to Pages.

Think of this repository like a folder on your computer. In JNL 221, you're frequently organizing our HTML, CSS and content files for different projects in one folder. Once everything is working the way you want it to locally (meaning on your own machine), you can upload those files to a Github repository and maintain the organizational structure you used there.

### How this repository is organized:

```
├── images/
│   ├── Armorysquaresyr.jpg
│   ├── Destiny_USA.png
│   └── Syrcityhall2.jpg
├── index.html
├── other.html
└── README.md (the file you're reading)
```

### Things to keep in mind:
* __File names matter.__ Even a slight difference will throw things off. `index.html` is different than `index(3).html` and `INDex.HTML`
* __Paths to files matter.__ If I want to show the image `Armorysquaresyr.jpg` in my HTML file, I have to point toward `images/Armorysquaresyr.jpg` because it's located inside a folder. (More on [file paths](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp).)
* __Changes may not be instantaneous.__ 

### I want to:
* Upload a file
* Edit a file
* Remove a file
* Publish to
